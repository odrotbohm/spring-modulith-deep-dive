[[fundamentals.creating-modules.objectives]]
== 🎯 Objectives

You'll learn how to…

* … create an application module within the application.

[[fundamentals.creating-modules.preparations]]
== 👣 Preparations

1. Create a test class in the application's root package in `src/test/java` named `ApplicationModularityTests`.
2. Within that class, create a test case to create a new instance of `ApplicationModules` pointing to the root Spring Boot application class.
3. Print the result of `ApplicationModularityTests.toString()` to the console.
Note, how it stays empty at first.

[[fundamentals.creating-modules.adding-a-module]]
== 👣 Adding a Module

1. Create a package `order`.
2. Add a public type `OrderManagement` in that package.
+
[source, java]
----
include::{source}/order/OrderManagement.java[tags=class]
----
3. Re-run the test case to see an application module named `Order` is listed, as well as `OrderManagement` as public component.

[[fundamentals.creating-modules.further-ideas]]
== 💡 Further ideas
* What happens if you add sibling packages to `order` containing Spring bean classes in them?
* How does changing the visibility modifier of the types in the packages change the test output?
* How does the test output change if you introduce a dependency between components in different modules?
