= ðŸ“– Fundamentals of Application Module design

A module is a logical concept that corresponds to a bounded context.

In the context of microservice architectures using Spring Boot, each bounded context is typically managed as a separate Spring Boot application and deployed as an independent artifact.
Short of the actual packaging and deployment, there has been no other support within Spring Boot to distinguish between bounded contexts within a single Spring Boot application.

Now, with Spring Modulith, you can express bounded contextsâ€”or modulesâ€”within a Spring Boot application on top of packages, and deploy all modules as a single artifact.

The following are the key concepts behind package-based support for modules:

- An application module's base package is considered its API package.
- Any nested package is considered module-internal. Code residing in it is not allowed to be accessed by other application modules.
