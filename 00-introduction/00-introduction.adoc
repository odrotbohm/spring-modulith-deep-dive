=== Working with the document

We use the following icons to represent different parts of the document

* 🧑‍💻 -- A lab.
* 🎯 -- Describes the learning goals of the lab.
* 👣 -- Describes a set of steps to complete a topical lab.
* 📖 -- Describes a section of contextual content, often referring to sections of the slide deck.
* 💡 -- Summarizes the lab and often include ideas of how to take the code of the lab further.

WARNING: Most of the steps include fractions of the code to be added to a project.
The code samples often have important parts folded (indicated by the `…` icon in the lower right corner if you hover over the code block).
Be sure to use the clipboard icon to copy the whole content.

[[introduction.domain]]
== The domain

The example we are going to use is rooted in the e-commerce domain.
As the focus of Spring Modulith is creating a high-level functional structure and implementing and testing the interaction between the individual parts, we don't need to exhaustively cover the entire domain but will rather focus on the following arrangement:

* A catalog that contains products, primarily consisting of a description and a price.
* An order management module that contains orders consisting of line items referring to the products contained in the catalog.
* An inventory management that keeps track of the stock for each product.

endif::[]

The primary use case we will investigate in its implications on both the structural, consistency and interaction arrangement is the following: when an order is completed (i.e., flips a certain state), a variety of functionality will have to be triggered:

* The inventory needs to update its stock to reflect the products referred to by the items contained in the order leaving the warehouse.
* An email notification needs to be sent out to the customer.
* A customer loyalty program needs to record bonus points reflecting the total value of the order.

[[introduction.sample-code]]
== 🧑‍💻 Sample Code

The sample code can be found in https://github.com/odrotbohm/spring-modulith-deep-dive[this GitHub repository].
It consists of individual folders per lab, each of them containing an `initial` folder that contains the playground to start with.
The lab descriptions in the document here help you understand the goal and walk you through a set of steps to explore a certain piece of functionality of Spring Modulith in the context of the domain.
If you get stuck or need some inspiration, you can check the content of the `complete` folder as it contains the project in the shape the individual steps should have guided you to.
