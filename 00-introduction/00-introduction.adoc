[[introduction.sample-code]]
== 🧑‍💻 Sample Code

The sample code can be found in https://github.com/odrotbohm/spring-modulith-deep-dive[this GitHub repository].
It consists of individual folders per lab, each of them containing an `initial` folder that contains the playground to start with.
The lab descriptions in the document here help you understand the goal and walk you through a set of steps to explore a certain piece of functionality of Spring Modulith in the context of the domain.
If you get stuck or need some inspiration, you can check the content of the `complete` folder as it contains the project in the shape the individual steps should have guided you to.
